## About Me
I’m Wang Xinhao and I’m now a third-year undergraduate student majoring intelligence science at School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science in Peking University, China.

Currently, I’m working as an intern student at [STRUCT Team](www.wict.pku.edu.cn/struct/), Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Jiaying Liu](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/struct/people/liujiaying.html).

I’m interested in computer vision and style transfer.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NeverMore808/NeverMore808.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
