## About Me
Hi! I’m Wang Xinhao(王欣灏) and I’m now a third-year undergraduate student majoring intelligence science at School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science in Peking University, China.

Currently, I’m working as an intern student at [STRUCT Team](www.wict.pku.edu.cn/struct/), Peking University, supervised by [Prof. Jiaying Liu](https://www.wict.pku.edu.cn/struct/people/liujiaying.html).

I’m interested in computer vision and style transfer.
